# Kirby Air Riders 1.3.3 on build 160

This branch starts at Lichii `build-160`, commit
`2eb5f081c8734affd272466f89133aa4e3e56e18`.

## Baseline reproduced

The unmodified Windows executable (SHA-256
`7ecc9e7dddafe30d4a3068fa94631aade875ede73f99de4d6337b5072d422a98`)
crashes before reaching the main menu with Windows exception `0xc00000fd`.
The test used the full title `040077201BE50000`, version 1.3.3, a copied
portable profile, and an initially empty shader cache. Physical controller
bindings were disabled in the test profile to isolate injected game input.

The exception-thread unwind contains 1,615 recursive return frames at
`lichii.exe+0x1ac16be`, with a 0x260-byte stride. The direct self-call belongs
to `CollectIteratorWords` in
`src/shader_recompiler/ir_opt/global_memory_to_storage_buffer_pass.cpp`.
That traversal alone consumes approximately 982 KiB of the executable's
1 MiB default stack reserve. The native dump and disassembly are retained
locally; they are not repository artifacts.

## Diagnostic experiment

A separate executable with only its PE stack reserve increased to 64 MiB
reaches the main menu and starts Floria Fields. This is a diagnostic
experiment, not the proposed compatibility fix or a validated deliverable.
Reversible menu inputs confirm debug-controller control of Player 1.
The observed first race has reached lap 2 of 3, but has not yet passed the
race/results/restart acceptance test.

Later logs show invalid placeholder device addresses beginning at
`0xffffff8120def000` and native MME split-front instruction-limit errors
at macro start `0x1d2`. These are separate unresolved observations; the
stack-reserve experiment does not establish full compatibility.
